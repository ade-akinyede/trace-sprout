    <h1>Privacy Policy for TraceSprout</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: May 4, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>
      TraceSprout ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This
      Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the App. We
      do not collect, store, or share any personal data, and we aim to be
      transparent about our practices.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      The App does not collect any personal data, such as your name, email
      address, location, or device identifiers. The App uses the following
      functionalities:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Camera Access</strong>: The App requests camera permissions
        solely to scan product barcodes. No images or other data are captured,
        processed, or stored beyond the barcode information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Barcode Data</strong>: When you scan a barcode, the App
        retrieves environmental impact information (e.g., carbon footprint,
        water usage) from the Open Food Facts API. This data is not linked to
        you or your device.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      The App stores your previous barcode scans in a local Room database on
      your device. This data is not transmitted to any servers or third parties.
      You can delete this data at any time through the App’s settings.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Open Food Facts API</strong>: Provides environmental impact data
        based on scanned barcodes. No user data is sent to or received by Open
        Food Facts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Google ML Kit Barcode Scanning SDK</strong>
        (com.google.android.gms:play-services-mlkit-barcode-scanning): Processes
        barcode scans locally on your device. No user data is shared with Google
        or other entities.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>No user data is collected or shared by these services.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not share any data (personal or otherwise) with third parties,
      except as required by law.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Since the App does not collect personal data, there is no personal
      information to access, correct, or delete. You can clear locally stored
      scan history at any time via the App’s settings.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 16. We do not
      knowingly collect any data from children.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>
      Any barcode scan data stored locally on your device is protected by your
      device’s security features (e.g., PIN, password, or biometric
      authentication). No data is transmitted or stored on external servers.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be
      communicated through App updates on Google Play. Please review this policy
      periodically.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Legal Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>
      The App is developed and operated by John Doe, based in England, United
      Kingdom. This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of England and Wales.
      The App is designed to comply with applicable privacy regulations,
      including the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and Google
      Play’s Data Safety requirements.
